# My Awesome iOS Apps

A curated list of my iOS apps.

## Assumptions
- All of the apps mentioned here are free, unless explicitly stated.
- Prices are for Ireland (usually include 23% VAT), which differs for other countries.
- Some prices are given in different currencies, as they did not provide local pricing.
- Some apps have been tested and very subjectively assessed by me - these will link to pages in this repo.
- Other apps - not tested & described - are marked as ðŸ”— (external links).

## A very subjective star rating more less means:
- â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… - An exceptional app. Get it at once and cherish it.
- â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… - A very good app. top of the class.
- â˜…â˜…â˜… - Decent app. Does the job.
- â˜…â˜… - Crappy app, not worth looking at it.
- â˜… - Absolutely dreadful app. I wish I hadn't seen it.
