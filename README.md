# Mobile Scanners
- [Evernote Scannable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/evernote-scannable/id883338188) ★★★★ - best of all tested. Quickly scans & saves to Photos (not too many taps required). Straightens the scans & applies some color filters and does not constantly nag to upgrade or pay like many others.
- [Adobe Scan: PDF & OCR Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-pdf-ocr-scanner/id1199564834) ★★ - requires account! (Subscription: $10/m).
- [Scanner Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-document-scanning/id333710667) ★★★ - too many buttons and clicks, and useless functions, e.g. storing scans in iCloud requires pro, but syncing with iCloud doesn’t. Weird UI. Not a straightforward flow (e.g. saves docs to its own internal storage, and requres manually “exporting” them outside). Some basic functionality is free, but full featured app is not. (Paid: $30)
- [iScanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iscanner-pdf-scanner-app/id1035331258) ★★ - lots of functions, most of which, when clicked - popup a "Pro" screen, asking for money. Convoluted workflow (lots of taps required to scan and save to photos). Scans don’t look great. (Paid: $15)
- [Tiny PDF Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-pdf-scanner/id1105479069) ★★ - lots of functions, most of which, when clicked - popup a “Premium” screen, asking for money. Convoluted workflow (lots of taps required to scan and save to photos), scans don’t look great. (Paid $3)



# Games, Music, Life and Other
