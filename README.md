# My Awesome iOS Apps

A curated list of my iOS apps.

## Assumptions
- All of the apps mentioned here are free, unless explicitly stated.
- Prices are for Ireland (usually include 23% VAT), which differs for other countries.
- Some prices are given in different currencies, as they did not provide local pricing.

## A very subjective star rating more less means:
- ★★★★★ - An exceptional app. Get it at once and cherish it.
- ★★★★ - A very good app. top of the class.
- ★★★ - Decent app. Does the job.
- ★★ - Crappy app, not worth looking at it.
- ★ - Absolutely dreadful app. I wish I hadn't seen it.

# Bookmarks & collection managers
- [GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app) ★★★★ - quite good for the purpose (Paid: $5)


# Development
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app) ★★★★ - as far as git on mobile goes - this is probably the best one can get. (Paid: $20)
- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com) ★★★★ - pretty neat code editor on a phone (or tablet). (Paid: $10)
- [ShellFish](https://secureshellfish.app) ★★★★ - probably the best ssh terminal emulator on mobile. (Subscription: $10/y or Lifetime: $40)

# Mobile Scanners
- [Evernote Scannable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/evernote-scannable/id883338188) ★★★★ - best of all tested. Quickly scans & saves to Photos (not too many taps required). Straightens the scans & applies some color filters and does not constantly nag to upgrade or pay like many others.
- [Adobe Scan: PDF & OCR Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-pdf-ocr-scanner/id1199564834) ★★ - requires account! (Subscription: $10/m).
- [Scanner Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-document-scanning/id333710667) ★★★ - too many buttons and clicks, and useless functions, e.g. storing scans in iCloud requires pro, but syncing with iCloud doesn’t. Weird UI. Not a straightforward flow (e.g. saves docs to its own internal storage, and requres manually “exporting” them outside). Some basic functionality is free, but full featured app is not. (Paid: $30)
- [iScanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iscanner-pdf-scanner-app/id1035331258) ★★ - lots of functions, most of which, when clicked - popup a "Pro" screen, asking for money. Convoluted workflow (lots of taps required to scan and save to photos). Scans don’t look great. (Paid: $15)
- [Tiny PDF Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-pdf-scanner/id1105479069) ★★ - lots of functions, most of which, when clicked - popup a “Premium” screen, asking for money. Convoluted workflow (lots of taps required to scan and save to photos), scans don’t look great. (Paid $3)



# Games, Life and Other
- [Meditation](https://meditationapp.wixsite.com/download-app) ★★★ - the app doesn't look much, but has 1 great feature: you can use any mp3 with guided meditation or music and customize everything else and the app will sync your mindfulness minutes to the Apple's Health app. And it's free!
- [Lichess](https://lichess.org/mobile) ★★★ - less bloated than the chess.com and has unlimited free puzzles.



# Productivity & automation
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) ★★★★★ - probably the best calendar app for mac (Subscription ~€44/yr)
- [Parcel](https://parcelapp.net) ★★★★ - Tracks deliveries and can automatically fetch amazon orders! (Subscription ~€3.5/yr)



# Social, News & Itenrnet
- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io) ★★★★ - A beautiful Reddit app built for power and speed. Free, but you can get some niceties when buying pro (Pro: $5-$10).



# Task managers
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) ★★★★★ - Best task manager (Paid: $10).
