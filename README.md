- [Craft](https://www.craft.do) ★★★★ - note taking and organizing app (Subscription: $60/year, with a good free tier).
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com) ★★★ - the workhorse of a note taking app. Low friction, high usability. Lots of integrations. Used to be great, now it's getting worse (and slower) with every release. (Subscription: ~$99/year, but frequent discounts ~40%).

- [Adobe Scan: PDF & OCR Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-pdf-ocr-scanner/id1199564834) ★★ - requires account! (Subscription: $10/m).
- [Scanner Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-document-scanning/id333710667) ★★★ - too many buttons and clicks, and useless functions, e.g. storing scans in iCloud requires pro, but syncing with iCloud doesn’t.

(Paid: $30)
- [iScanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iscanner-pdf-scanner-app/id1035331258) ★★ - lots of functions, most of which, when clicked - popup a "Pro" screen, asking for money. Convoluted workflow (lots of taps required to scan and save to photos). Scans don’t look great. (Paid: $15)
